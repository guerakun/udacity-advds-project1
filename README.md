This is the repository for the 1st Project for the Advanced Data Science Nanodegree.

We are using this airbnb Open dataset from 2020 and 2023 to answer the following questions:
1. In the available data, which neighborhood group/neighborhood can we most likely find a place with the highest price to rent? 
   (Therefore a potential neighborhood to invest). Are there any change between 2020 and 2023?
2. What is the average number of places does a host have in airbnb? Any change between 2020 and 2023?
3. How is airbnb trending between 2020 and 2023 using total number of listing, total number of listing a host has (if available in both 2020 and 2023), and number of new hosts (only available in 2023 but not in 2020) as a percentage of the whole 2023 data.
